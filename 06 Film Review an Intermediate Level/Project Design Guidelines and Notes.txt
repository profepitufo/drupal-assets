PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To create a Film Review Site similar to rogerebert.com
=============================
Design Principles/Notes:

1. Only use Drupal Core - no external modules used.

2. There are basically 3 popular types of review sites 
   - sites on which some Expert makes reviews (e.g: rogerebert.com), 
     or where general public (registered users) makes ratings (e.g IMDB). 
   - Third type is an review aggregation site (e.g. rottentomatoes.com). 
      ** We are implementing the former (expert based).

3. Note: There are a few external modules that provide Ratings/Review. 
   - but since we are not using external modules yet, 
     I have implemented a simple hack to get 
     5-star ratings using Content Type Fields. 
	** Modules which can give ratings feature: Fivestar, Rate, Star

========== STEPS TO IMPLEMENT PROJECT ==========

Step 1: Install Drupal.
** En la seccion BASIC SETTINGS, colocar el Nombre, Slogan, Imagen Logo, Favicon, etcetera.
** En la seccion de ACCOUNT SETTINGS, marcar la opcion ADMINISTRATORS ONLY, para la seccion REGISTRATION AND CANCELLATION.
------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Select Theme and install it
------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Based on theme choice, Configure Site name, slogan, front page
	- I have used free theme "Showcase LITE" url:
	<https://www.drupal.org/project/showcase_lite>
	- This is a free version of a premium theme 
	- with some functionality not available. 
	- Make only basic configurations at the beginning 
	- we will come back to this later.
------------------------------------------------			
Step 4: Create new Taxonomy called as 
	"Film Genre"
	"Film Certification"

* Taxonomy FILM GENRE [for Taxonomy Creation]: 
** Terms
	-Action [URL alias : "/ActionFilms"]
	-Adventure [URL alias : "/AdventureFilms"] 
	-Biography [URL alias : "/BiographyFilms"]
	-Comedy [URL alias : "/ComedyFilms"]
	-Documentary [URL alias : "/DocumentaryFilms"]
	-Drama [URL alias : "/DramaFilms"]
	-Horror [URL alias : "/HorrorFilms"]
	-Musical [URL alias : "/MusicalFilms"]
	-Science Fiction [URL alias : "/ScienceFictionFilms"]

* Taxonomy Film Certification: 
	-Description: Designated to classify films with regard to
	suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex,
	violence, substance abuse etcetera.
** Terms
	- General (G) – General. The content is very mild in impact.
	- Parental Guidance (PG) – Parental guidance recommended. 
	- Mature (M) – Recommended for mature audiences. 
--------------------------------------------------------------			
Step 5: Create new custom Content Type called as "Film Review"
	* Name: Film Review
	* Description: Use "Film Review" content type to create
		movie reviews
	* Submission form settings tab: no changes
	* Publishing Options: no changes
	* Display Settings: Disable "Display author and date information"
	  checkbox. Because we will create a separate author field.
	* Menu Settings: Disable all menus
--------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Add all of these 13 new custom Fields to the new Content Type created - followed by our 2 new taxonomy terms

** New fields:
	Reviewer [Text (plain)]
	Review Date ["Date only" - don't choose "Date and Time"]
	Director [Text (plain)]
	Screenplay [Text (plain)]
	Review Rating [List (integer)]
---------------------------------------------------------------
	IMPLEMENTING THE RATING FIELD
	- Use field type "List (integer)" and in options use this values (so there will be select/radios with stars shown, but stored as a integer):
	5|★★★★★
	4|★★★★☆
	3|★★★☆☆
	2|★★☆☆☆
	1|★☆☆☆☆
	- The only limitation with this technique is - there are no half-stars! Half-stars give 10 level granularity. A 10-level granularity can be achieved by making 10 star design instead of the 5 stars. These are alternatives you could try out. 
	- What other ways could you design/implement this? Share your creative ideas in the Q&A section.
	1|★
	2|★★
	3|★★★
	4|★★★★
	5|★★★★★
-----------------------------------------------------
	Review - just rename the "Body" field with name "Review"
	Dialogue [Text (plain)]
	Music [Text (plain)]
	Story [Text (plain)]
	Cinematographer [Text (plain)]
	Editor [Text (plain)]
	Composer [Text (plain)]
	Run Time [integer]
	
** Existing Fields: 
	Image
	Tags [Autocomplete (Tags style)]
----------------------------------------------------------
Step 7: Manage "Form Display" tab. 
	* Arrange the fields as how you you would like them 
	to appear on the content creation form. 
	
	* A rule of the thumb is - 
		a. Title (or name) should always appear first
		b. more important data and required fields 
		   should appear higher on the form. 
		c. Related data should be grouped together
		d. Any trivial data should sink to bottom of the page
	
		Authored By - widget - Autocomplete
		Film Genre - widget -  Checkboxes/Radio Buttons
		Film Certification - widget - Checkboxes/Radio Buttons
-----------------------------------------------------------	
Step 8: Manage "Display" - Default Full View
	- Make label "inline" for all new fields that we created
	- Make label "hidden" for image field, 
	  make sure it appears right after Title
-----------------------------------------------------------
Step 9: Manage "Display" - Teaser View
	- Display in this order: 
	  Image [label: hidden] 
	  [Image Style: Large (480x480) ; Link image to: Content]
	  Review: [Label: hiden] [Format: Summary or Trimmed]
	  Review Rating [Label: inline]
	  Reviewer [Label: hidden]
	  Links

<at this stage you have a fully functional site - the next steps are optional - and done for improved usability/visual design>
-----------------------------------------------------------------	
Step 10: You are ready to create content! Create atleast 10 reviews. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 11: Optional design: 
* You can create 2 different image fields instead of just one 
  - the additional image to be used only for the teaser view. 
  - This technique is used in rogerebert.com
------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 12: Optional design: 
* Create a new custom block "Mov.ie Club"
* Place this block in the "Sidebar Second" region
------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 13: Optional design: 
* Create a new menu using Film Genre Taxonomy 
Structure > Menus > "Add menu"
- Give name like "Film Genre Menu"

NOTE: This entire process is exactly like creating a new Taxonomy Vocabulary
- Add links - use same terms as Taxonomy "Film Genre"
- For links in the menu, use the same exact URL alias created from the "Film Genre" vocabulary
- Place this menu in the "Sidebar Second" region
-----------------------------------------------------
Step 14: Congrats, Project #6 has ended - look at the assignment
