PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Create a simple Drupal based eCommerce site catering men's shoes, built upon the UberCart module. 
------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: CAVEATS FOR THIS PROJECT
- We will build a minimal eCommerce site, as suitable to the Scope of this course. So, that means, we will not be covering all the features of UberCart extensively. The focus is on learning/teaching Drupal Modules - NOT on building an complex ecommerce site. Therefore, specialized features are not addressed.
- I encountered a couple of minor bugs both with UberCart and the theme that I used. I chose to retain them as it is, to show you a real picture of what type of issues you will face in a real life situation - and this is what you should base your expectation upon. There were workarounds for them and I will mention it in the lessons. 
----------------------------------------------------
Steps to recreate Project 8: Simple eCommerce Site:


step 1: Install Drupal. 
	- I have used Drupal 8.X
	
About UberCart: It implements everything you need to start selling products online. Supports a variety of E-Commerce options - including physical goods, digital downloads, and even subscription based billing services. Fully integrated with PayPal right out of the box.

<optional Site Config - setup automatic emails>
	
step 2: Install UberCart module

	- You can download it from here <https://www.drupal.org/project/ubercart>
	- UberCart package will install multiple modules automatically (5 new sections: Ubercart core, Ubercart Optional, Ubercart Extra, Ubercart payment, Ubercart Shipping)
	- Enable the following modules (this is the MINIMAL set required for our project)
	- Everything from UberCart Core.
	- From Optional
	  Enable Catalog, Payment and Report.
	- In Payment
	  Enable "PayPal" Module.	
	- OPTIONAL: Install "Admin Toolbar" module.
	
step 3: New Store and Content Type for Products

	- A new "Store" menu item appears in the Admin menu after UberCart installation. This is a complete configuration dashboard to control every aspect of UberCart on Drupal
	- a new Content Type called "Product" is created

step 4: Configure The Store

	- First, configure the store from the "Store Configuration" page
	- Payments, shipping, roles and downloads 
	- Shipping - assign shipping carriers / Free shipping / Flat Rates
	- Payment gateway integration - prebuilt like Authorize.Net, Paypal Standard etcetera.
	- I have used Paypal Express Checkout (reasons are detailed fully in the video lesson)
	- NOTE: Disable Checkout (unless you have secure SSL certification and all it's implications - collecting personal information on an unsecured page)
	- NOTE: it is possible to use Ubercart as a physical store's inventory management system - with stock settings - albeit with very simple requirements
	
step 5: Build a Catalog. 

	* Catalog is just a Drupal Taxonomy - so create terms in same fashion. 
	* Give URL alias as shown in square brackets below:
	* OPTIONAL AND NICE: Associate an image with each term. Use any of the appropriate product images.
		Sandals, [/sandals]
		Slippers, [slippers]
		Casual Shoes, [/casual_shoes]
		Formal Shoes, [/formal_shoes]
		Boots, [/boots]
		Sports Shoes, [/sports_shoes]

NOTE: the more powerful way of categorizing products is through "Product Classes" - and this will allow adding product attributes and variants
	
step 6: Create Products [refer the other text file for content material]

	- Use Title and Body - from the attached text file
	- HINT: for ease, use the same test for Title, SKU and image's alternative text
	- Use Images from download resources (observe their naming convention first - and use appropriately)
	- Use the same image file name as SKU
	- Map every Product to the Taxonomy/Catalog term - IMPORTANT
	- Price - as you like
	
	
step 7: Edit the teaser view of Product

	- remove SKU, Weight and Dimensions from teaser Display (drag and drop to the Disabled section)
	- Edit image. Format - medium, linked to content. Move to top location. 
	- OPTIONAL: Also edit the full view if you want
	
step 8: Add Theme

	- At this time (May 2017), there are no free Ubercart special optimized themes
	- Zircon was the closest I found 	<https://www.drupal.org/project/zircon>
	- You can experiment with any theme of your fancy that will suit an ecommerce site. Many normal popular themes can be tried also
	- Add Login link and Shopping cart link (only if necessary, according to the theme you select)
	
	
step 9: Frontpage design
	
	Configuration > Basic Site Settings>
	- Site name: "We Got Sole!"
	- Point "Default Front Page" to the Catalog => "/catalog". NOTE: this is actually a special view created by Ubercart
	
	People > Permissions page>
	- IMPORTANT: Catalog > View Catalog permission --> enable for both Anonymous User and Authenticated User
	- Add the Catalog block to any sidebar region
	
	Structure > Block Layout>
	- Add Catalog Block
	- Add any additional HTML blocks as you like, to display marketing / SEO content

step 10: Do a site testing and review

	- Paste screenshot of your site on the Q&A section of the course.
