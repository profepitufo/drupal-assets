-------------------------------
Welcome to this new section. Congrats on having come so far - but there is still a lot more ahead to go!! 

This is an INTERMEDIATE LEVEL project. This means that I will not be repeating the basics. It will also mean the projects will be more complex - and so you should be completely hands-on. In some cases, I will only show directions for a few items - and you should explore in greater depth. Nothing to fear though - an important part of learning will be discovery. 

STEPS TO REPLICATE THE PROJECT.
-------------------------------

STEP 1. install Drupal
	- I have used Drupal 8.2.6 for this project

STEP 2. Change Site name and Logo
	- Logo image is available in section resources

STEP 3. Change theme 
	- research suitable themes
	- I have used Mayo theme
	- <Mayo theme specialities/customization>
	(very colourful, 30 pre-set colour scheme options, individual colours customizable)
	** Color Scheme: Sepia
	** Logo Image (imagen mujer cocinando, proporcionada en folder)
	** Favicon (misma imagen anterior, se puede)

STEP 5. "Manage Fields", Associate Article content type with all newly created vocabularies

	Structure / Content type 
	En el renglon del Article, seleccionar: Manage Fields
	Agregar los Nuevos Campos uno por uno para cada Vocabulario
	* Cooking Styles
	* Diet & Health
	* Dish Type
	* Ingredient
	* Meal Type
	* Regional
	* Spice Indicator

STEP 6. "Manage Form Display" for Article Content Type
	- modify positioning for your taxonomy terms [move above body]
	- select widget [according to limited/unlimited choices you had given earlier]

	* Meal Type - Check boxes / Radio Buttons
	* Diet & Health _ Select List
	* Ingredient - Select List
	* Spice Indicator - Select List
	* Cooking Style - Select List
	* Dish Type - Select List
	* Regional - Check boxes / Radio Buttons

STEP 7. "Manage Display" - for Article Content Type - to change how the homepage will look
	- ONLY for the TEASER view mode
	- change "Body" - make trimmed length to 100 characters

STEP 8. Create Recipes Content - using Article Content Type
	- create at least 10 recipes
	- make all taxonomy selections (else they will not get selected from the menu!)
	
STEP 9. Modify Main Navigation Menu 
	- Add new Terms corresponding to the Taxonomy that you have created
	- start with the top level menu links - these will be the vocabulary names. Link all of them (top level menu links) to the front page <front>.
	- Don't forget to add taxonomy URLs to the new terms you are creating - corresponding to the "alias URLs" from before
		
STEP 10. OPTIONAL: Create a suitable Home Page (use Basic Page content type)
	
ADVANCED ASSIGNMENTS: 
1. How will you remove Authoring Information? Eg: "Submitted by admin on Mon, 04/24/2017 - 18:44" - this should NOT appear with your post
2. If you are using the MAYO theme - try installing the SuperFish menu plugin - you will find instructions on the theme download page
3. Build a simple workflow for content creation - by defining roles and permissions.
